A Jupyter notebook to transcribe finnish Microsoft Teams :tm: meetings to a text file.

I added the annotation with <i>pyannote</i>, but it has some difficulties. This means, that in order to use the notebook, you have to register for pyannote as the annotation is done in the same for loop as the transcription. Annotation slows the process quite much..

All further instructions in the notebook.
