A Jupyter notebook to transcribe finnish Microsoft Teams :tm: meetings to a text file.

Unfortunately, the actor recognition is not available.  Could be done with Pyannote (https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio), but would require registration :frowning_face:

All further instructions in the notebook.
